               <p> Hello user. Since you are here I think you are already interested in me. Let me start by introducing myself. <br>
                My name is Ihsan Dinc. I am 24 years old. I am originally from Turkey. I have been living in Belgium for about 2 years. <br> 
                I live in Kumtich with my sister and my mother.  
                 </p>
                 <br>
            <h2>My career</h2> 
            <p>    I have graduated from Ankara University Faculty of Law in 2018. In my university years,
               I have been President of Ankara University Debate Society and board member of many student clubs. 
               I have won many awards in open debate tournaments in British Parliamentary style and in several Model United Nations 
               conferences. In the summer of 2016, I have done an Erasmus internship in Düsseldorf by Next Media company. 
               I have contributed to the renovation of the firm's main website, also learning about and practicing advertising
                production. Also, I was a volunteer for a project that aims to summarize in plain language the popular websites' 
                terms of use agreements and privacy policies, including Facebook, Google, Evernote, etc.
                I have taken part in setting up the website and reviewing the privacy policies of 8 websites.  <br>
             <br>
             During my studies, I have had always an interest in programming but I did not how to improve myself in this area. 
             When I came to Belgium, first I tried to do find work in law but it was difficult to get an equivalence as a 
             lawyer in Belgium. Then I've searched for possibilities to learn to program and to find a job in this area. 
             Exactly 1 year ago I have started the vooropleiding Web development education for foreigners in Dutch by VDAB. 
             In this course, I have learned several web development tools, scrum and most important I have realized that 
             I love writing programs and being a part of a production process. In October I have started with Java Enterprise 
             Developer course by VDAB. After two months I have been accepted by Java-Fin as Java Developer.
              Also, I follow the dutch course level of 2.4.    </p>

              <br>
            <h2>My hobbies</h2>
            I am an average guitar player and 1 month ago I have started to play the piano - I can play the first 
            part of moonlight sonata and blue(da ba dee) so it's going good so far :) -. 
            I love going to concerts, before the corona pandemic I went to 3 concerts in Belgium.
            Since I come from social studies I love reading books especially in history. 
            Also, I love meeting new people, hearing about different experiences and perspectives. I am good at playing table tennis.
